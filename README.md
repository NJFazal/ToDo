        <h1>Project Title</h1>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#10024;</span>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is a fun little Halloween themed to do list.</p>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128187;</span>How To Run:</h2>
        <p>To use this to do list you will have to view it through a http://localhost8080. I suggest installing http-server through the terminal first. Once that is set up, you can add to the to do list or even get rid of items by clicking on them.</p>
        <h2><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128679;</span>Roadmap to Future Improvements:</h2>
        <p>I made this around the time of Halloween, so in the future, I would make it a more classic theme. I would also like to add a function that celebrates completing a task by showing a quick animation of my cat or something.</p>
